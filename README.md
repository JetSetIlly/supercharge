# Supercharge

Supercharge converts Atari200 ROM files to WAV files, suitable for use with
the `Supercharger` cartridge.

Not all ROM files can be converted for use on the Supercharger and not all ROM
files that can be converted are yet supported by `Supercharge`.

Supercharge is an alternative to the `makewav` program written by Bob Colbert
but does not offer as many switches or options.
